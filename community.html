        <h2>Magic Found in Unexpected Places</h2>
        <p>During my visit to Disney World, I encountered a kind-hearted custodial staff member who noticed my daughter's fascination with Cinderella. He took the time to share a heartwarming story and even drew a beautiful Cinderella illustration for her. It was a magical moment we'll never forget.</p>

      <!-- Visitor Story 2 -->
      <div class="visitor-story">
        <h2>A Proposal Fit for a Disney Princess</h2>
        <p>My partner surprised me with a fairytale proposal at Disneyland. With the help of Disney cast members, he arranged a private horse-drawn carriage ride through the park, leading us to a picturesque spot where he got down on one knee. It was a dream come true and a moment filled with pure joy.</p>

      <!-- Visitor Story 3 -->
      <div class="visitor-story">
        <h2>Generosity and Sharing the Disney Magic</h2>
        <p>While waiting in line for a popular ride, a family next to us struck up a conversation. When they found out it was our first visit, they surprised us by offering their FastPasses, allowing us to experience more attractions. Their kindness and selflessness made our trip even more memorable.</p>
